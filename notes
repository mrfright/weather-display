use weather.gov api for lakewood
https://api.weather.gov/points/41.4808,-81.8003

this seems for current weather
https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/CLE/79,63

all others are after using only short description
https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/CLE/79,63/forecast

this site suggests this
curl -s https://www.moongiant.com/phase/today | grep "Illumination:"

take note of 
startTime	"2021-02-04T13:00:00-05:00"
endTime	"2021-02-04T18:00:00-05:00"

in first/current forecast
if current time is after that end time, update

also need to get things like email and app name in request headers as curtesy to the weather api
